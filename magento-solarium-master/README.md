The default MySQL Fulltext search is not performing very well on more serious shops. It is slow and the results aren't very relevant. Apache's Solr does a much better job in delivering fast and relevant results. I have used the Solarium PHP library to build Solr into Magento CE. If you have some funds available for improvements, pleas contact me.

This extension is also on [Magento Connect](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/solr-search-based-on-solarium.html).
